here need route params category filtering.
=>api/v1/products/{$categoryName}
for example,
 if api route is "api/v1/products/cleanroom" (GET)
 then the data should be all the products for cleanroom category

same way, 
 "api/v1/products/hvac" (GET) => products of HVAC category 
 "api/v1/products/air-filtering" (GET) => products of air-filtering category
